                             just drawing pictures and creating my own style of art. I was not so concerned about the finished product as I was with just enjoying the 
                             process of taking whatever was going through my mind and placing it onto paper, into a tangible representation of my ideas. 
                             Most of the time I would simply toss aside the drawings and continue on with whatever other activities I got into as a kid 
                             (until my parents found them and saved them for me to look back on several years later).</p>

							<p>As I got older, I began to value the outcome of my creativity. I took as many art classes as possible in high school and was able 
							to produce paintings, drawings and mixed media that I was proud to display wherever I could. There was a specific graphic design 
							project my class completed senior year in which we created a product and then designed the logos, colors, marketing and branding for 
							it as well. I knew from this point on that I wanted to make design the main focus of my future career.</p>

							<p>Fast forward to college, where I aimed to maximize my university experience. I chose to major in Business Administration with 
							a concentration in Information Systems. I knew that this would provide me with the technical background that I needed to leverage 
							my skills, as well as the ability to hone in on the other aspects of web development. My goal was to become as well-rounded as possible 
							when it came time to enter into the corporate IT world.</p>

							<p>I am constantly looking for ways to practice my skills, develop new ones, and learn as much as I can about front end development <i class="fa fa-star-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

                            <p>I begun my experience at Xavier University without any solid direction, as many students do. My major was undecided for the first semester 
                            as I entered into a whole new world of possibilities. By the time semester two rolled around, though, I decided that I wanted 
                            to bring out my creative side and declared a Business Administration major with a concentration in Marketing. </p>

							<p>I stuck with this for about a year and for the most part I loved the classes I was taking. But I also began to realize that what
							 I was learning was more theory-based and involved less hands-on creativity. I wanted to be direct with my learning experiences; 
							 actually bringing something to life in my projects instead of just explaining my ideas in papers and reports. So I decided to switch 
							 tracks and declare an Information Systems major instead. The most exciting part of this was the challenge it presented me with, knowing 
							 that learning the inner workings of various types of software would be very new and different for me. </p>

							<p>Making that switch was the best choice I could have made during my college career. I began to learn about all of the different
							 types of programs and applications used by enterprises, including Tableau, Visual Studio, Salesforce, SQL, Visio, and more. The nature of 
							 learning in these classes was so much more fun for me, because most of the work we were given to complete was to produce our own content and
							 projects by learning the software as we went along. I have always been best at the "learn as you go" approach, and continue to use it today. 
							 I figure that's how the real world works anyway!</p>

                            <p>The first corporate project I was ever a part of was the development of an application called SARA, which stands for "Security
                            Access Review Application". This application was built as a means to automate managers' access approvals for 
                            various pieces of software and systems used throughout the company. The application was developed in conjunction with the University
                            of Cincinnati's student-run IT Solutions Center. They created the original prototype to demo to our team, and we then took the 
                            design concepts to build the application completely from the ground up.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <img src="img/project/sara-left-nav.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">

        							<p>Left navigation design to incorporate all elements needed by the administrator to create and manage access reviews.</p>
      							</div>
                            <hr>
							<p>SARA was built with a Node.JS back end and an Angular front end, along with Bootstrap for CSS. Up until this point, I had zero 
							exposure to the various frameworks used to build responsive applications such as this one. But after a summer of working closely 
							with the developer to create SARA, I quickly developed a grasp on the basic web design and development concepts.</p>

							<p>My specific role for this project was based around designing the best user experience and creating a working style guide for the 
							application. I created several different wireframes in Axure to display the various options for enhancements once we had debuted 
							SARA in  production for the first time. I met with managers across many departments and held usability sessions where I would 
							allow them to walk through the wireframe options on their own so that they would be able to express what their initial first impressions 
							were upon seeing these enhancements for the first time. This was done to gauge which UX path was the most intuitive across the board.</p>

							<p>Holding these usability sessions and really taking the time to find the best user experience for the application helped 
							immensely in the long run. SARA became overall more intuitive, easier to use, and simplified the user experience so that 
							the users weren't introduced to unnecessary components when they didn't need (or want) to be.</p>

							<p>The best part about this project for me was the opportunity I was given to learn all about the various frameworks used in a corporate 
							development project, as well as getting to take on the responsibility of determining a functional user experience. It was 
							a great introduction into the world of front end design and development!</p>

                            <img src="img/portfolio/gateway.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">
                            <hr>
                            <p>Towards the end of my internship when I was transitioning into working full time, I joined a new team to begin development on 
                            a project that would replace the company's intranet. The corporate intranet is basically a hub of information that anyone throughout 
                            the company might need to access at any given time. This includes travel information, expense reporting links, and HR / payroll information. 
                            The new intranet, named "Gateway" to brand itself as "a gateway to all company information", was built in Microsoft SharePoint 365 Online.</p>
                            
                            <p>Up until this point, I had never used SharePoint. It was an entirely new platform that I was introduced to, and I took it upon myself 
							to become a SharePoint expert by the time we started configuration in the site - which only gave me a few months to learn. 
							I started out small, first creating subsites and setting up the general foundation 
							on which the rest of the site would be built. And, as with all software, the more I learned the more I was able to do. I began building out 
							pages as well as setting up libraries and lists in the back end and determining the best ways to display these on the UI.</p>

							<p>Further along in the project I had met most of the business unit heads and became somewhat of a technical resource for them. They came to 
							me with general questions and requests for complex changes that required more in-depth technical SharePoint knowledge. Looking back, a lot of 
							my knowledge actually stemmed from researching enhancements that could be made within the limits of SharePoint's framework. For example, each 
							business unit was given their own page to display department-specific information. So making changes to the look and feel of these specific 
							pages was best done from CSS snippets added into Content Editor Web Parts, where they would affect only the particular page and nothing else 
							on the site, like a change to the core CSS might do. This was a unique introduction into the world of front end development for me, since I 
							was both learning the ins and outs of CSS and Jquery and also finding solutions for how to best incorporate these techniques into our site.</p>

							<p>One of the most exciting parts of the project for me was when I was given the chance to remodel the Mega Menu (top level global navigation) 
							to revamp the look and make it responsive for tablet and mobile view. I learned all about CSS media queries and certain JavaScript techniques 
							to make the responsive design smooth and flexible.</p>
							
                            <p>Below are a few screenshots of the different view ports used in the responsive design for Gateway.</p>

							<p>All in all, this was one of the most exciting projects that I've worked on for many reasons. On a larger scale, it was exciting to be one of the 
							first teams to host an enterprise-wide project entirely in the cloud, which was brought to life in a span of just under eight months. On a more 
							personal level, it was an exciting opportunity for me to learn an entirely new software as well as really refining and developing my front end 
							skills.</p>

							<p>Up until the beginning of our project, all that was displayed on the screen was the name of the business college and the current
							channel it was tuned to, which was usually either CNN or the weather. Our group's mission was to create more value for the Williams College
							of Business students and faculty using the real estate offered by the large screen. We sent out a preliminary survey to gather 
							opinions from the administration about what was important for them to be seeing on the screen, and from that we derived a list of items to 
							incorporate into the digital signage. These included: the time and date (very simple, but very much requested), TV set up to be tuned to Xavier 
							basketball games on game days, a Twitter RSS feed showing tweets from the business school Twitter account, and a list of events in the upcoming 
							months, which pertained both to the business school and Xavier in general.</p>
							
							<p>Our team took an agile approach to begin developing these enhancements. Our first "production" release was simple yet effective. 
							It displayed the time, date, shrunk the TV portion to a smaller size to allow for more space, updated the layout and background of the screens, 
							and displayed a simple static list of the events that would be occuring in the business school that month. I took the role of front-end designer 
							and business analyst, working with the administration to gather events that we needed to display as well as designing the layout of how 
							each item would fit onto the screen.</p>
							
							<p>As the semester progressed, we continued to build out functionality. We built an events calendar for the business school and connected it to 
							the front end so that the list of events could be dynamic rather than static, as well as adding and configuring the Twitter RSS feed. I was very 
							proud of the final product and how much work we had put into it, knowing that although this was a class project, it would actually be adding value 
							to the business school.</p>
